<br><font color=white ><h3 style="border-style:double;border-color:white;border-width:6px;">Chhath Parva, also known as Chhath Puja, is a significant Hindu festival celebrated primarily in the Terai region of Nepal and the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh. It is dedicated to the worship of the Sun God, Lord Surya, and his consort, Usha, the goddess of dawn. Chhath Parva is observed for four days, typically in October or November, following the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.The festival holds great cultural and religious importance, with devotees offering prayers, fasting, and performing rituals near rivers, ponds, or other water bodies. The rituals of Chhath Parva are meticulously observed and involve a rigorous purification process, abstinence, and deep devotion.On the first day, known as Nahay Khay, devotees take a holy bath in rivers or ponds before sunrise. They observe a strict fast and eat only one meal during the day.The second day is called Kharna, during which devotees observe a complete fast from sunrise to sunset. In the evening, they break their fast after offering prayers and sharing the prasad (holy offering) with family and friends.The third day, known as Sandhya Arghya (evening offerings), is the main day of Chhath Parva. Devotees gather at the water bodies, usually near riverbanks or reservoirs, and offer prayers to the setting sun. They perform a series of rituals, including standing in water, offering fruits, flowers, and special prasad (known as Thekua), and singing traditional songs dedicated to Lord Surya.On the fourth and final day, known as Usha Arghya (morning offerings), devotees wake up before sunrise and gather at the water bodies once again to offer prayers to the rising sun. The devotees express their gratitude to Lord Surya for granting them blessings, prosperity, and good health. After the rituals, the fasting is concluded, and devotees break their fast, marking the end of the Chhath Parva celebrations.Chhath Parva is characterized by its austere and disciplined observances, as well as its deep spiritual significance. It is believed to cleanse the mind, body, and soul and bring well-being, prosperity, and happiness to the devotees and their families. The festival also highlights the close relationship between humans and nature, as it centers around the worship of the Sun, which is considered a symbol of life, energy, and vitality.The celebrations of Chhath Parva create a vibrant atmosphere with traditional songs, music, and cultural performances. The devotees, dressed in traditional attire, come together as a community, fostering unity, camaraderie, and a sense of shared devotion.Chhath Parva is a beautiful and sacred festival that showcases the deep spiritual connection between humans and nature. It reflects the cultural diversity and religious traditions of the region, leaving a profound impact on those who participate and witness the celebrations.</h3></font>
