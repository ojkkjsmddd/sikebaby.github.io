Lasting for five days, Tihar holds a special place in the hearts of Nepalese people, illuminating the country with joy, positivity, and cultural significance. Each day of Tihar is dedicated to honoring various aspects of life and nature, creating a beautiful tapestry of rituals and festivities.The first day of Tihar is Kag Tihar, where crows are revered as messengers of good luck and are offered food on rooftops. This act symbolizes the belief that even the smallest creatures deserve respect and gratitude.The second day is Kukur Tihar, a day to honor dogs, who are regarded as loyal companions and guardians. Dogs are adorned with garlands, tika (a colored powder), and fed delicious treats as a sign of appreciation for their companionship and loyalty.The third day is Gai Tihar and Laxmi Puja, dedicated to cows and the goddess of wealth, Laxmi. Cows are considered sacred in Hinduism and are worshipped for their significance in agriculture and sustenance. In the evening, elaborate puja (worship) ceremonies are held to invoke the blessings of Goddess Laxmi, followed by the lighting of oil lamps and decorating homes with colorful rangoli patterns to welcome prosperity and abundance.The fourth day of Tihar is Mha Puja, a day dedicated to self-worship and honoring one's own existence. It is a time for introspection, purification, and gratitude for the blessings received. Families gather for a special puja ceremony that involves the worship of one's own body, followed by a festive feast and cultural performances.The final day of Tihar is Bhai Tika, a day to celebrate the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters perform intricate rituals, applying tika on their brothers' foreheads, garlanding them with flowers, and offering them sweets and gifts. This ceremony symbolizes the deep love, protection, and bond shared between siblings.Throughout Tihar, the streets, homes, and public spaces are adorned with beautifully crafted oil lamps, called diyos, and colorful decorations. The entire atmosphere is filled with joy, laughter, music, and cultural performances, creating a sense of unity and celebration across the country.Tihar is not only a time for merriment and festivities but also an occasion to express gratitude, foster relationships, and seek blessings for prosperity and well-being. It showcases the cultural richness, religious diversity, and social harmony of Nepal, leaving a lasting impression on locals and visitors alike.</h3></font>
