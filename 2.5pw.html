<br><font color=white ><h3 style="border-style:double;border-color:white;border-width:6px;">Teej is a vibrant and joyous festival celebrated primarily by women in Nepal and certain parts of India. It holds immense cultural significance and is dedicated to the goddess Parvati, the epitome of marital bliss and fertility. The festival falls in the Hindu month of Bhadra, usually between August and September, during the monsoon season when nature is at its peak beauty. Teej is a three-day celebration filled with rituals, fasting, dancing, singing, and elaborate ceremonies that bring women together in a spirit of unity and devotion.

The first day of Teej, known as Dar Khane Din, revolves around feasting and enjoying delicious traditional food. Women dress in vibrant red attire, often adorned with intricate henna patterns on their hands and feet, and gather with friends and family to relish sumptuous meals. The atmosphere is filled with laughter, joy, and a sense of camaraderie as women sing and dance to traditional Teej songs that reflect the essence of love, marriage, and womanhood.

The second day of Teej is called Hartalika Teej, which is marked by rigorous fasting. Women wake up early, bathe, and wear new clothes as they offer prayers to Parvati, seeking her blessings for a happy and prosperous married life. Many women observe a nirjala vrat, a fast without food or water, which is considered a test of their devotion. They spend the day engaging in religious activities, reciting prayers, and visiting temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and Parvati.

The final day of Teej is called Rishi Panchami, where women pay homage to the Sapta Rishis (seven sages) by performing rituals and seeking forgiveness for any sins committed knowingly or unknowingly. This day signifies purification and the importance of maintaining physical and mental well-being. Women offer prayers and perform a ceremonial bath in holy rivers or water bodies to purify their souls.

Teej is not just a religious festival but also a time for women to express themselves and celebrate their identity. It serves as a platform for women to showcase their traditional attire, intricate jewelry, and impeccable henna designs. The festival also serves as a reminder of the importance of marital bliss and the sacrifices made by married women. It fosters a sense of solidarity among women, with married women supporting and guiding unmarried girls about the essence of married life and the significance of maintaining strong bonds within the family.

Teej is a festival of colors, music, dance, and devotion. It encapsulates the essence of womanhood, love, and the power of unity. It brings women together, enabling them to share their experiences, dreams, and aspirations. Through this celebration, the festival not only strengthens family bonds but also empowers women to embrace their cultural heritage and take pride in their roles as daughters, wives, and mothers. Teej is a time of merriment, spiritual reflection, and an occasion for women to revel in the joy of being a woman.</h3></font>
